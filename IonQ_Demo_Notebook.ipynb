    "### \"Can't I just use a Simulator for free?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response:** Simulators are perfect; reality is not. These metrics predict how the algorithm survives on *real* hardware. If the gate count is too high in simulation, it *will fail* on a real physical machine due to decoherence and error accumulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Why is IonQ slower (clock speed) than Superconducting?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response:** True, ions move slower than electrons microscopically. But because our circuits are *shorter* (fewer SWAPs, efficient native gates), Time-to-Solution is often comparable. More importantly, our Probability-of-Success is much higher because we avoid the noise trap.\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Is this accessible now?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response:** Yes. Everything you see here runs on Azure Quantum or Amazon Braket today via the IonQ Aria or Forte chips. You can test this in a free tier account.\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"How does this compare to X competitor's latest chip?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response:** Connectivity is architectural, not a scaling issue. As qubit counts grow, the connectivity problem *gets worse*—more qubits = exponentially more SWAP overhead on linear topologies. Our all-to-all approach scales better fundamentally.\n",
